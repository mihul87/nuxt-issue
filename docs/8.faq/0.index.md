# FAQ

1. `useFetch` composable VS `$fetch`

   Whenever you have an issue with `useFetch` composable, try to use `$fetch`. If it's not available you can import it (this module is built into nuxt).
   
   `import { $fetch } from 'ofetch'`

2. `public` VS `assets` directory

   You mainly want to use the `public` directory for your static files like fonts, images, videos, etc. They are not processed by bundlers (vite/webpack) but e.g. nuxt/image will still optimize tem.

   The `assets` is only for files that will be processed by bundlers, and therefore also need handlers installed.

3. Server Side Rendering VS Server components
